Set up your IoT devices: You will need to choose IoT devices such as sensors and actuators to monitor and control your greenhouse environment. You can use devices that communicate using protocols such as MQTT or HTTP.

Set up a Mosquitto broker: Mosquitto is an open-source message broker that implements the MQTT protocol. You can use Mosquitto to receive data from your IoT devices and publish it to AWS IoT Core. You can set up Mosquitto on your local machine or in a Docker container.

Create an AWS IoT Core endpoint: AWS IoT Core is a cloud-based platform that enables you to connect your IoT devices and securely transmit data to the cloud. You can create an endpoint by navigating to the AWS IoT Core console and following the setup process.

Configure your IoT devices to connect to the Mosquitto broker: You will need to configure your IoT devices to connect to the Mosquitto broker. This typically involves providing the broker URL and security credentials such as certificates and keys.

Write Python code to collect and transmit data: You can use Python to collect data from your IoT devices and transmit it to the Mosquitto broker using the paho-mqtt library. The library provides a range of functions to publish and subscribe to MQTT topics.

Create an AWS infrastructure using Terraform: Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code tool that enables you to define and provision your AWS infrastructure. You can use Terraform to create AWS resources such as EC2 instances, security groups, and IAM roles.

Set up a Docker container for your Mosquitto broker: You can use Docker to create a container for your Mosquitto broker. This enables you to easily deploy and manage your Mosquitto instance, and to ensure consistency across multiple environments.

Deploy your AWS infrastructure and Mosquitto broker using Docker: You can use Terraform and Docker to deploy your AWS infrastructure and Mosquitto broker. This typically involves running Terraform commands to provision your resources, and running Docker commands to deploy your Mosquitto container.

Store and process data using AWS services: Once your data is transmitted to AWS IoT Core via the Mosquitto broker, you can use other AWS services to store and process it. For example, you can use Amazon S3 to store raw data, Amazon Kinesis to stream data to other services, and Amazon DynamoDB or Amazon Aurora to store and query data.

Set up alerts and notifications: You can use AWS services such as Amazon SNS and Amazon CloudWatch to set up alerts and notifications based on your data. For example, you can set up alerts to notify you when temperature or humidity levels exceed a certain threshold
